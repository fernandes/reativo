# Reativo

It's my personal library, where I try to make Rails more Reactive (Reativo is the portuguese word for Reactive).

No, it's **NOT** a replaced for [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/) or [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) and will never be.

So what is it? I've been seen myself replicating code over some rails projects, with some _patterns_ I've been constantly using, so one day I decided, I'm over! I need a gem to make myself easier to use.

And here I am

This gem rely a lot on Trailblazer ecossystem, devise, jwt and a lot of things that I find useful and make part of my workflow.

## Usage

How to use my plugin.
